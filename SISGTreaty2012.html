This proposal builds on the &ldquo;Option C&rdquo; in Sovereign Insolvency Study Group &lsquo;State insolvency: options for the way forward&rsquo; in the International Law Association Report of the Seventy-Fourth Conference (The Hague 2010) (International Law Association, London 2011) 978 (at pages 31ff) (which report of the study group will be referred to in this document as the &quot;Interim Report&quot;). The terms of Option C from the Interim Report are incorporated and referred to below.</span></h6><h6 class="c0"><a name="h.ph4jbhe2t9i7"></a><span>This document is arranged as an annotated </span><span>Statute of law for state signatories. Grey italicized text is an annotation on the body text. This document will be referred to in this document as the &ldquo;Treaty&rdquo;, and the tribunal created by the Treaty that may determine disputes between states in financial distress and their creditors will be referred to in the comments as the &ldquo;Tribunal&rdquo;.</span></h6><h6 class="c0"><a name="h.k43ngiaqgdw6"></a><span>The objective of this work is to illuminate a credible model for embodying, and illustrating in that model, those principles that are in the opinion of the study group applicable to the restructuring of public sovereign debt.

Some alternatives proposed by members of the study group are equally as viable as the options chosen for incorporation into this work, and this work should not be considered the end of a discussion on a viable orderly sovereign bankruptcy regime, but the beginning.</span></h6><h6 class="c0"><a name="h.nve7h1kti9qu"></a><span>&nbsp;This proposal represents a deviation from the basic principle of &lsquo;pacta sunt servanda&rsquo;, being the premise that states must be held accountable for their promises. This deviation is based upon the policy rationale that the strict enforcement of debt obligations on a state often results in significant negative repercussions (wastage and unfairness) that can be mitigated by imposing upon parties to the debts a system for disclosure, negotiation of resolution, and a fallback to a binding determination through an impartial tribunal. This deviation from the strict adherence to contractual obligation is commonly referred to as &ldquo;bankruptcy&rdquo;.</span></h6><h6 class="c0"><a name="h.w8na2eb9c4y4"></a><span>The essential features of this regime are:</span></h6><ol class="c29" start="1"><li class="c0 c11 c7"><h6><a name="h.h1ds8fg2te53"></a><span>The binding of all parties by treaty to either:</span></h6></li></ol><ol class="c30" start="1"><li class="c2 c0"><h6><a name="h.cdj7ni8bvl1"></a><span>a work-out through a majority vote by creditors;</span></h6></li><li class="c0 c2"><h6><a name="h.gkpkokz13hqm"></a><span>a determination by an independent and impartial permanent tribunal.</span></h6></li></ol><ol class="c29" start="2"><li class="c0 c11 c7"><h6><a name="h.8vkux9fsxumg"></a><span>A Living Will where debtors may indicate:</span></h6></li></ol><ol class="c30" start="1"><li class="c2 c0"><h6><a name="h.7569o3gpljqu"></a><span>the instruments involved;</span></h6></li><li class="c2 c0"><h6><a name="h.w4ng74l6k4kc"></a><span>any pre-conditionality for re-financing;</span></h6></li><li class="c2 c0"><h6><a name="h.60go61ogulwu"></a><span>the mechanism for account and distribution of assets;</span></h6></li></ol><ol class="c29" start="3"><li class="c0 c11 c7"><h6><a name="h.44y5x5qayzfx"></a><span>Priority re-financing (akin to &ldquo;debtor-in-possession&rdquo;)</span></h6></li><li class="c0 c11 c7"><h6><a name="h.5gvqzqnu5b43"></a><span>An independent monitor with investigative powers;</span></h6></li><li class="c0 c11 c7"><h6><a name="h.z1gv5b3ogxdf"></a><span>Voluntary activation by a state debtor;</span></h6></li><li class="c0 c11 c7"><h6><a name="h.5qqtgo4nifcw"></a><span>Investigative powers of discovery and disclosure;</span></h6></li><li class="c0 c11 c7"><h6><a name="h.hakg1kj45waa"></a><span>An administrative body that acts as a quasi-legislative/regulatory body and can make and change the rules of procedure</span></h6></li></ol><h6 class="c0 c20"><a name="h.y1uwscvhd475"></a><span>The regime for financial administration shall encourage expediency, certainty, finality, fairness, and principled resolution.

Perhaps the most challenging practical issue is that for any mechanism to be effective the United States must almost certainly ratify the instrument.
