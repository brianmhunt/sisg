  <span>document</span><span>&nbsp;contains a proposal for a treaty
  that may be enacted by states to create a mechanism that permits
  sovereign states to restructure their debts. This proposal builds
  on the “Option C” in Sovereign Insolvency Study Group ‘State
  insolvency: options for the way forward’ in the International Law
  Association Report of the Seventy-Fourth Conference (The Hague
  2010) (International Law Association, London 2011) 978 (at pages
  31ff) (which report of the study group will be referred to in
  this document as the "Interim Report"). The terms of Option C
  from the Interim Report are incorporated and referred to
  below.</span></h6>

  <h6 class="c2"><a name="h.ph4jbhe2t9i7" id=

  arranged as an annotated</span> <span>Statute of law for state
  signatories. Grey italicized text is an annotation on the body
  text. This document will be referred to in this document as the
  “Treaty”, and the tribunal created by the Treaty that may
  determine disputes between states in financial distress and their
  creditors will be referred to in the comments as the
  “Tribunal”.</span></h6>

  <h6 class="c2"><a name="h.k43ngiaqgdw6" id=
  "h.k43ngiaqgdw6"></a><span>~ The objective of this work is to
  illuminate a credible model for embodying, and illustrating in
  that model, those principles that are in the opinion of the study
  group applicable to the restructuring of public sovereign debt.
  The study group is not advocating this work as necessarily the
  only solution, but rather a piece for discussion that illuminates
  the principles legal experts have put forward as important issues
  for discussion.</span></h6>

  <h6 class="c2"><a name="h.wdt4ygsdjf4h" id=
  "h.wdt4ygsdjf4h"></a><span>~ Where differing opinions have been
  put forth, this work seeks to incorporate them either directly or
  in comments. Some alternatives proposed by members of the study
  group are equally as viable as the options chosen for
  incorporation into this work, and this work should not be
  considered the end of a discussion on a viable orderly sovereign
  bankruptcy regime, but the beginning.</span></h6>

  <h6 class="c2"><a name="h.nve7h1kti9qu" id=
  "h.nve7h1kti9qu"></a><span>~ &nbsp;This proposal represents a
  deviation from the basic principle of ‘pacta sunt servanda’,
  being the premise that states must be held accountable for their
  promises. This deviation is based upon the policy rationale that
  the strict enforcement of debt obligations on a state often
  results in significant negative repercussions (wastage and
  unfairness) that can be mitigated by imposing upon parties to the
  debts a system for disclosure, negotiation of resolution, and a
  fallback to a binding determination through an impartial
  tribunal. This deviation from the strict adherence to contractual
  obligation is commonly referred to as “bankruptcy”.</span></h6>

  chosen as the mechanism for illuminating how one may codify the
  principles of sovereign bankruptcy because of the relative
  clarity and concision available. Perhaps the most challenging
  practical issue is that for any mechanism to be effective the
  United States must almost certainly ratify the instrument. There
  are a number of mechanisms that may serve in stead of a treaty
  (e.g. model law, amending articles of the IMF or UN, contract,
  and bilateral treaties); these alternatives are beyond the scope
  of this document.</span></h6>

  requires approval of the US Congress, whereas amendment of the UN
  Articles requires ***?***. Alternatively, the President of the
  United States may form and negotiate a treaty, but the treaty
  must be advised and consented to by a two-thirds vote in the
  Senate.</span></h6>

  this Treaty;</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c2"><span>“</span><span class=

  amount payable by a debtor state in respect of a liquidated money
  demand, recoverable according to the legal process of the law
  chosen law by a debtor state in its Living Will or otherwise by
  agreement, as well as any other obligations of the debtor state

  “domestic” and “foreign” debt can be defined and ought to be
  treated differently. The distinction between domestic and foreign
  debt can be the choice of law (domestic or foreign), choice of
  currency, or another distinction. This distinction may also be
  left to the debtor to set out in its living will.</span></h6>
